# LAB - 02

## About ME

I built an app that will greet and ask the user 5 questions with response to their answers then ending with an outro message to the user. I created a “Top Ten” at the bottom of my HTML page which was my top ten movies. I then added a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number where through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”. Finally, I added a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array where the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.

### Reflections and Comments
* I felt this lab went really well, was not that difficult to complete.
It took me 2 hours to completed which is how long I expected it to take.
